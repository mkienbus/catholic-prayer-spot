                    Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, 
                    implored thy help, or sought thy intercession, was left unaided. Inspired by this confidence I fly unto thee, 
                    O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate,
                    despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.
